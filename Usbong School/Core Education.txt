What a person should learn in life to be a contributing member of the community (simplified version)

1) Love of learning
--> taught via osmosis
--> "I'm happy to be here."
--> "I'm going to learn something today."

2) Ability to learn how to learn (Most Important Skill)
a) Tools (know-how)
--> natural: listening (mother tongue) -> speaking (mother tongue), observing
--> techniques: reading (priority #1 if already mother tongue) -> writing; listening (foreign language, 2 years of continuous listening, similar to how infants learn) -> speaking (foreign language)
--> machine tools/technology: computer, mobile phone
--> a) offline: Microsoft Office (WORD, PPT, EXCEL (least training required if task is only filling up a logbook)), dictionary apps
--> b) online: gmail, google search (spelling), Khan Academy, Usbong Store

//Note: Besides reading and writing (in one's mother tongue), it is important to learn a foreign language, e.g. English, to be able to work in multinational companies whose clients are non-local nationals.

b) Way of Thinking
i) think in a manner that is logical/organized
ii) question, e.g. how do you know you're not a robot/program? (philosophical; "loving search for truth")
iii) decide what is true for you, e.g. moral dilemmas, by reading books, essays, etc.
--> This shows various ways of looking at things; interpretations.
iv) debate with people about the readings
--> The goal is not to decide who wins or not, who is right or wrong, but to practice how to express oneself through verbal communication.
v) teach, where a person learns to explain in a clear manner to another person/s what one has learned; organize one's thoughts

c) Way of Non-thinking
--> perform tasks that shouldn't require a lot of conscious thinking, e.g. washing the dishes, cleaning room, cooking food, riding the bicycle, jogging/exercise
--> do routine work
--> learn to stop oneself from putting interpretations/reasons/explanations on things/events/everything

3) Outcome:
--> logical, organized, efficient
--> self-confident, e.g. what do you do when you're asked a question which you don't know what the answer is?
--> quiet confidence
--> cheerful, kind
--> person of integrity, i.e. "mensch", someone whom you can trust to give you advice for your benefit rather than his or her own.
