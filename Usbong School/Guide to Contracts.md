# Guide to Contracts
## 1) Read
Please make the time to read the License Agreements, Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, etc.<br>
I've learned quite a number of things by reading them.<br><br>
The following is an example:<br>
<br>
YOU AND USBONG SHALL FIRST CONSULT WITH EACH OTHER TO ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE SUCH DISPUTE IN A MANNER SATISFACTORY TO BOTH PARTIES, AND THAT IF A RESOLUTION IS NOT REACHED WITHIN NINETY (90) DAYS, THEN THE DISPUTE SHALL BE REFERRED TO AND RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION.

## 2) Write
You can learn a great deal by writing your own Terms of Service, albeit you may need an authorized person to endorse it.<br><br>
I've learned that writing such contracts helped me understand to a certain extent the power relation between two parties.<br>
<br>
For example, who requires the approval from whom?<br>
<br>
In addition, in most cases, the tendency is that you'd want to have as much, if not all the power/control as you can, such that the other party must require your approval to do certain things.<br>
