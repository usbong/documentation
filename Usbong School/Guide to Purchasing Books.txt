I realized that a person can go to a secondhand shop like Booksale, but wouldn't have any clear idea which book to buy.

I've noted down here what I do before I make a purchase, which is kind of like discerning fake news.

Guide to Purchasing Books

Verify the following:
+source
--> e.g. author, publisher

+recommending person/entity
--> a) an author, whose book has made an impact in my life, would have a list of recommended readings
--> b) a publisher who has published many books that have made an impact in my life
--> c) a teacher/friend/family member who has made an impact in my life

+content, i.e. read it yourself
--> e.g. read the Title/Table of Contents, skim through the book

+price
--> e.g. in my case, I usually buy books whose price/cost per item would typically be at most about 150pesos
