# Language Learning with Technology Assistance

## 1) [Human Language Translation Tools](https://github.com/usbong/documentation/blob/master/Usbong%20Translation%20Services/Human%20Language%20Translation%20Tools.md)

## 2) Human Language Class Policy
### Example: Filipino Only Policy
Learning a language does not happen only in class. It is very important to use the target language in real life. That is why we strongly encourage you to speak Filipino in every situation. As a Filipino course policy, you are required to talk to all Filipino instructors in Filipino except for emergency situations. Your effort to use Filipino could be evaluated as part of your class performance in Reading & Writing classes as well as Spoken Filipino class.

### Note:
Updated to "Filipino" from "Japanese"
