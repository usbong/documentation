### Notes:
1) Black Swan Theory</br>
--> atypical events that have 3 distinguishing characteristics:</br>
--> a) rarity, i.e. observed data do not show the possibility of its occurrence</br>
--> b) high impact</br>
--> c) retrospective predictability</br>
--> <b>Reference:</b> Taleb, N. (2010). The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable. New York: Random House

2) Butterfly Effect</br>
--> a) "...seemingly small and contained shocks can escalate into systemic dislocations because the effects can spillover from institution to institution and  from market to market."</br>
--> b) "...the idea that small things can have non-linear impacts, i.e., the flap of a butterflyâ€™s wings may cause a tornado."</br>
