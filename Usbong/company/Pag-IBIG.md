# Pag-IBIG
<b>1) Minimum Accepted Monthly Payment Contribution:</b> 200pesos<br /><br />
<b>Note:</b><br />
Shared between Employer and Employee at 50%, i.e. 100pesos and 100pesos respectively<br />

<b>2) Minimum Total Months to Receive Total Payment Contribution with Dividends:</b> 120months<br /><br />
<b>Note:</b><br />
The computation of the dividends, however, is not clear.<br />
From my understanding, it depends on the performance of the people, i.e. the government, and the administration.<br />
Nonetheless, the principal, i.e. the total payment contribution, is preserved.<br />
This means that the total payment contribution with dividends only increases, albeit how big the dividends add to it may vary.<br />
<br />
Therefore, we Filipino citizens living in the Philippines must actively participate to make the administration most productive in its task to make life fair for everybody.<br />
<br />
This is done by doing the following among others:<br />
1) voting on issues/rules<br />
2) filing incidents/issues/reports<br />
3) paying contributions, e.g. PhilHealth, SSS, Pag-IBIG<br />
4) paying taxes, if applicable<br />
<br />
Regarding the voting of representatives, I disagree that the present state, which depends on mass media, e.g. radio, TV, is effective in communicating those who are truly capable administrators.<br />
<br />
Instead of verbal/oral communication, what appears vital is written communication.<br />
<br />
In addition, instead of voting for representatives, we vote regarding issues/rules.<br />
<br />
When the decision-making power regarding issues/rules further becomes the task and responsibility of each registered voter, the primary role of administrators becomes handling the remaining bureaucratic paper-work that cannot yet be processed by computer automation, and the execution/enforcement of the law.<br />
<br />
With this, each registered voter need not simply depend/rely on a voted representative by delegating the voting task to that person or group of persons (select few).<br />
