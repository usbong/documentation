<br/>
<b>Reminder:</b> In addition to SOUND, there exists Visual stimulation.<br/>
<br/>
verified: technology to be over 10years old due to technique reused in the Year 2008, while SYSON, MICHAEL B. was Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW) to Tokyo, Japan<br/>
<br/>
identified: inside workplace's Global Office Unit, telephone network misused to cause visual stimulation, e.g. stepping of vehicle pedal motion.<br/>
<br/>
verified: technique reused in Central Park, New York City, while SYSON, MICHAEL B.<br/> 
was with Dr. SYSON, PEDRO, et al;<br/> 
<b>visual stimulation:</b> getting money out of wallet<br/>
<br/>
identified: Teroristang Komunista group to be repeatedly misusing telephone number of Dr. SYSON, PEDRO (GLOBE Post-paid SIM Card), et cetera via unauthorized access to a duplicate number<br/>
<br/>
<b>Reminder:</b> SYSON, MICHAEL B. uses SMART Prepaid Cards; sometimes set to NON-ROAMING, i.e. NO International Network Access.<br/>
<br/>
observed: magnetic pulse from nearby mobile telephone used to cause the Visual Stimulation<br/>
<br/>
<b>Reminder:</b> There exists "phosphene", i.e. a sensation of a light of flash in the absence of actual light stimulation to the eye<br/>

    phosphene
    n. a sensation of a light flash (as in “seeing stars”) in the absence of actual light stimulation to the eye. It may occur with the eyes closed and can be caused by mechanical stimulation of the retina, by rubbing the eyes, or by direct stimulation of the visual cortex. Also called visual phosphene. See also photopsia.

"The  current  IEEE-ICES  recommendations  were  developed  with  respect  to  short  term 
effects associated with electrostimulation. Exposure limits are designed to protect against 
short term reactions, including: painful stimulation of sensory or motor neurons, muscle 
excitation, alteration of synaptic activity in the brain, cardiac excitation, or adverse effects 
associated with induced potentials (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc. & 
IEEE, 2002)."<br/>
