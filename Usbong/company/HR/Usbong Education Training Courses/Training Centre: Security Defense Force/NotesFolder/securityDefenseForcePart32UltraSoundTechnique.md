> In the management of rheumatic diseases, ultrasound therapy (US) is commonly used as an adjunctive therapy for its proposed effects on inflammation as well as for pain relief. It uses sound waves at very high frequencies (0.5-5 MHz) to produce mechanical vibration within the tissues. If applied in high doses absorption of US results in heating, which decreases pain and fluid viscosity, increases metabolic rate and blood flow (thermal effects) (Nussbaum 1997). At lower doses of US or following pulsed US non thermal, mechanical effects such as stable cavitation (formation of gas bubbles in tissues), standing waves (reflected waves superimposed on incident waves) and acoustic streaming (fluid movement which exerts pressure changes on a cell) occur (Maxwell 1992) which cause membrane distortion, increased permeability, increased nutrient transfer and facilitation of tissue repair (Mortimer & Dyson 1988). When applied to acutely inflamed tissues it encourages the inflammatory process to progress to the proliferation stage (Watson 2000).

> Whilst there is evidence to support the physiological effects of US in laboratory or animal studies, (Mortimer & Dyson 1988) evidence for its clinical effectiveness in people with rheumatic conditions is limited (Brosseau et al 2004, Zhang et al 2007) and it is only recommended for those with arthritis of the hand (Casimiro et al 2002, Welch et al 2001). Moreover, a recent review concludes US may only be effective for people with carpal tunnel syndrome and those with calcific tendonitis of the shoulder (Roberston & Baker 2001) despite being a frequently used electrophysical modality in musculoskeletal conditions (Kitchen & Partridge 1996).
