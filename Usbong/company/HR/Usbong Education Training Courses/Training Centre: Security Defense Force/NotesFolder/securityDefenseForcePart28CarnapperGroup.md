[Example Audio: Noise Opening/Closing Gate](https://github.com/usbong/documentation/blob/master/Usbong/company/HR/Usbong%20Education%20Training%20Courses/Training%20Centre:%20Security%20Defense%20Force/res/nearHouseholdAutomobileVehiclesGateCreakingSoundFromCarnapperGroupHeardByMultiplePersonsAtGreaterThanOrEqualTo16mDistance%2CafterMultipleOpenCloseGateActionCreakingSoundStopsAlbeitMomentarily20211205T1619.m4a)
<br/>
<br/>
verified: with Filipino Citizen Mother, gate creaking sound heard at >= 16m distance from gate<br/>
--> After multiple open-close gate action, creaking sound stops.<br/>
--> Gate creaking sound returns when Filipino Citizen Mother comes toward the gate.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Notes:</b><br/> 
1) The gate is near household automobile vehicles, which are Keyed OFF.<br/>
2) There exists a CCTV Camera to supposedly provide security monitor surveillance of vehicles;<br/>
The CCTV Camera can be accessed using an Android application.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Observations:</b><br/>
--> observed: household Mitsubishi Montero Sport (Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV)) of over 10years old receives at times open/close signal, without our using its remote key.<br/>
<br/>
--> observed: household Honda Civic City of over 5years old receives at times open/close signal, without our using its remote key.<br/>
--> filed: incident report with Sta. Lucia East Grand Mall security team who was also witness<br/>
<br/>
<b>Reminders: </b><br/>
1) No TAX paid from income due to vehicular theft<br/>
--> Used SUV can still cost > PHP500,000, i.e. "half million"<br/>
<br/>
2) Vehicular incidents, e.g. theft, increase excess expenses @Insurance Company.<br/>
<br/>
3) Teroristang Komunista promulgates quick money, instead of <b>hanap-buhay</b><br/>
where: <b>hanap-buhay</b> = work to receive gradual increase of income based on service years and skill-level;<br/>
work contributes to Community・Family・Company<br/>
<br/>
<b>Additional Observations:</b><br/>
--> observed: income from their criminal actions, e.g. vehicular theft, became insufficient to their growing group whose members marry and have children.<br/>
<br/>
--> This is while the senior members grow older and the income does NOT increase due to members have NOT learned the value of honest work.
