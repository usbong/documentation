We classify the sound to be noise when it is NOT tone used with fax messaging and such at all.<br/>
It's additional sound specifically used to be noise to annoy, et cetera.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Reminder (regarding technique):</b> When a caller is interviewed on a Radio Program, there is a request to put the telephone mic far from the radio's speaker. This is due to it causes an infinite loop of feedback, resulting to noise.<br/>
<br/>
Using the network evesdropping technique via telephone mic, the Teroristang Komunista can send a broadcasting signal to a receiving vehicle radio whose speakers are near the target telephone's mic.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Result:</b> noise<br/>
