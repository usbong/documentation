<br/>
We classify the sound to be noise when it is NOT tone used with fax messaging and such at all.<br/>
It's additional sound specifically used to be noise to annoy, et cetera.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Reminder (regarding technique):</b> When a caller is interviewed on a Radio Program, there is a request to put the telephone mic far from the radio's speaker. This is due to it causes an infinite loop of feedback, resulting to noise.<br/>
Alternatively, the sound volume of the radio's speaker has to be lowered to NOT reach the telephone mic.<br/>
<br/>
Using the network evesdropping technique via telephone mic, the Teroristang Komunista can send a broadcasting signal to a receiving vehicle radio whose speakers are near the target telephone's mic.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Result:</b> noise<br/>
<br/>
<b>Reminder:</b> In Physics, we learn that sound carries energy.<br/>
That energy hits our eardrums when the sound as wave enters our ears.<br/>
A sufficient amount of energy can physically hurt our eardrums.<br/>
We know the amount of energy is sufficient because we already feel pain.<br/>
This leads to loss of hearing, which further leads to falling to the ground
due to being off balance.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Reminder (Network evesdropping technique):</b> Multiple telephones can use the same telephone number.<br/>
<b>Example:</b> When a telephone outside calls to that telephone number, the two (2) receiving telephones using that same telephone number can be used to listen and talk, i.e. receive and transmit the sound to electricity signals.<br/>
<br/>
verified: the budol-budol/carnapper/manloloko/cybercriminal/Teroristang Komunista group used and continues to use unauthorized access to the telephone network by using DR. SYSON, PEDRO'S GLOBE postpaid SIM telephone number.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Reminder (Wireless Broadcasting Equipment):</b><br/>
verified: the Teroristang Komunista has access to wireless broadcasting equipment, e.g. towers, to send at set frequencies wireless signals that reach multiple cities.<br/>
The frequencies can both be reserved, e.g. radio 94.7 mellow, or unused.<br/>
My mini radio that I set to an unused frequency to cause static noise as defense to their noise pollution received such signal.<br/>
Their attack was to demonstrate their power against those who do NOT obey their gawa-gawang patakaran (rules) that is NOT of the community.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Example Gawa-gawang Patakaran (Rules):</b><br/> 
Do NOT share know-how with People, including the Police.<br/>
Do NOT file incident reports with Law Enforcement.<br/>
<br/>
observed: this is due to the Teroristang Komunista group aims to be the "Law Enforcement" of their own gawa-gawang patakaran (rules) that is NOT of the community.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Reminder:</b> automobile vehicle's horn is used only for imminent danger.<br/>
--> Frequent noise causes incorrect response to actual imminent danger.<br/>
<br/>
observed: we are being caused to be used to the noise, such that we no longer classify it as gawa-gawa.<br/>
If the noise is really due to the vehicle, then the vehicle has to be repaired.<br/>
If it is NOT, then we destroy the manloloko.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Clock Ticking Sound:</b><br/>
[from 11 to 28seconds Clock Ticking Sound; Before and After No Clock Ticking Sound](https://github.com/usbong/documentation/blob/master/Usbong/company/HR/Usbong%20Education%20Training%20Courses/Training%20Centre:%20Security%20Defense%20Force/res/setVolumeMaxAt11To28SecsClockTickingBeforeAndAfterNoClockTickingSound20211129T2259.m4a)
<br/>
verified: the technique to be reused multiple times and places,<br/> 
e.g. 阿嬤 (Amah)'s room (when Grandmother (father side) was still alive).<br/>
<br/>
<b>Reminder:</b> such action is dangerous due to being misused to cause bomb threats.
