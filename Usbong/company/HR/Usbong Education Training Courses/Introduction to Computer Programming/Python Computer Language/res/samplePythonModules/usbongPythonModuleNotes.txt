I. Version:
1) Python3 (version: 3.8.2)
--> https://www.python.org/; last accessed: 20200619
2) LUBUNTU Operating System (version: 20.04 LTS)
--> https://lubuntu.me/; last accessed: 20200619

II. Commands:
1) Execute Python module, "halimbawa.py", as list of instructions, in Terminal.
python3 halimbawa.py

Output:
Kumusta po!
Kumusta! 

1.1) Reminders:
1.1.1) Re-verify that your current location, e.g. directory, folder, in Terminal is equal with that of the Python module, "halimbawa.py".
1.1.2) We execute the command in the Terminal Window, not in the Python Window.
1.1.3) We can use ampersand, i.e. "&", without space before it, so that we do not need to open another Terminal Window.
--> This is due to the computer creating a new process when we send the command to execute the Python module.
--> Example: python3 halimbawa.py&
1.1.4) We can use featherpad as our text editor in LUBUNTU
--> Example: featherpad halimbawa.py&

2) Execute Python module, "halimbawaDefinedSet.py", as file with defined set of instructions in the Python Window.
>>> import halimbawaDefinedSet.py
>>> halimbawaDefinedSet.greet()

Output: 
Kumusta po!

2.1) Reminders:
2.1.1) We execute the command in the Python Window, not in the Terminal Window.
2.1.2) We can set a shorter name of the already defined set of instructions in the file to be quickly reusable. 
--> Example: 
>>> g = halimbawaDefinedSet.greet
>>> g()

Output:
Kumusta po!

2.1.3) Whenever we update the Python Module file, we can use the following commands to quickly reload it.
>>> from importlib import reload
>>> reload(halimbawaDefinedSet)

III. Problem & Answer
1) Problem: The following Python command does not execute successfully.

>>> import turtle

Answer: Write and enter in the Terminal Window the following command to download the "tkinter" module.

sudo apt install python3-tk

Done!You should now be able to execute the command successfully.
