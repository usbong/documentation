## Traineeship Details
Our Traineeship is based on the Two-track vocational training:

### 1) There's a practical part that concentrates on actual work and the making of things.</br>
We give interns/trainees/apprentices actual tasks that would help the company grow.</br></br>
These include among others:</br>
a) writing feedback to determine how we can more properly organize ourselves in terms of communication</br>
b) evaluating the company to determine how we can achieve CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration) Level 5</br>
c) conducting Quality Assurance (QA) of our products/services</br>
d) developing new and add-on software using existing tools</br></br>

Given that we're a computer services company, the intern/trainee/apprentice ought to be able to understand computer software development.</br>
Having said this, besides the technical aspect, we've learned that the person should also understand business.

### 2) There's specialist theoretical instruction.</br>
We have the interns/trainees/apprentices do online courses and read offline materials.</br>
#### a) Online courses
Examples of these include among others:</br>
a) Java programming language</br>
b) Android Software Development</br></br>

#### b) Offline materials
Examples of these include among others:</br>
a) Code Complete</br>
b) The Different Drum</br></br>
Whichever course or material, the interns/trainees/apprentices would have to physically come to the Usbong HQ to <b>*teach*</b> what they've learned to the team.</br>
We then ask them questions that we don't necessarily know what the answer is.</br>
Here, it is important to be able to recognize the inter-relationship between seemingly unrelated fields, e.g. economics and computer science.
