## Additional Notes:
1) <b>Business Permit Renewal Fee: Payment Schedule</b><br/>

Q3: July 20th<br/>
Q4: October 20th<br/>

#### Notes:
1) You can pay all the remaining balance by the 2nd Quarter.<br/>
--> However, you already need to pay a portion of the fee by the 1st Quarter<br/>

2) The fee that you pay during the 1st Quarter is higher despite choosing to pay quarterly, i.e. divide by 4.<br/>
--> This is because you can only pay quartery the following:<br/>

--> Based on the total income for the previous year multiplied, for example, by 2.07044444444444%.<br/>
