# Business Permit (Renewal)
## Requirements:
1) Business Permit (Nakaraang taon)<br/>

2) Business Permit Renewal Application Form<br/>
--> Maaaring makakuha nito sa Marikina City Hall.<br/>
--> Awtomatikong ginagawa na rin ito gamit ang kompyuter.<br/>

3) Quarterly Financial Report (BIR)<br/>
--> Halimbawa: BIR Form 2551Q (Quarterly Percentage Tax)<br/>
--> If no earnings, secure an Affidavit of Nothing-to-Declare or Non-operation (may gumagawa na nito sa Marikina City Hall).<br/>
--> Bring complete SEC Certificate with Articles of Incorporation.<br/><br/>
<b>Notes:</b> Bring original copy and make one photocopy of each.<br/>
<b>Venue:</b> Marikina City Hall<br/>
<b>Approximate Total Cost:</b> PHP2000 for Business Permit Renewal (no earnings)<br/>
--> I've already added PHP500 to pay for the Cedula (of the Corporation).<br/>
--> The Total Cost varies depending on the earnings of the company.<br/>

## Additional Notes:
1) <b>Business Permit Renewal Fee: Payment Schedule</b><br/>
Q1: January 20th<br/>
Q2: April 20th<br/>
Q3: July 20th<br/>
Q4: October 20th<br/>

### Notes:
1) You can pay all the remaining balance by the 2nd Quarter.<br/>
--> However, you already need to pay a portion of the fee by the 1st Quarter<br/>

2) The fee that you pay during the 1st Quarter is higher despite choosing to pay quarterly, i.e. divide by 4.<br/>
--> This is because you can only pay quartery the business permit renewal fee (based on the total income for the previous year multiplied, for example, by 2.07044444444444%) and the garbage fee (PHP600).<br/>

3) Additional fees that you already need to pay in the 1st Quarter include:<br/>
a) <b>Barangay Clearance Fee:</b> PHP500<br/>
b) <b>Mayor's Permit Fee:</b> PHP120<br/>
c) <b>Sanitary Inspection Fee:</b> PHP400<br/>
d) <b>Sanitary Permit Fee:</b> PHP300<br/>
e) <b>Fire Inspection Fee:</b> PHP500<br/>
<b>TOTAL:</b> PHP1820
