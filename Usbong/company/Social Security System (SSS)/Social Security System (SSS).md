### Payment Reference Number (PRN)
The PRN is now a requirement when paying SSS Contributions.</br>
You can write the PRN above the row with the "TO BE FILLED OUT BY..." as an Employer (left column) or an Individual Payor (right column).</br>
You can auto-generate the PRN by logging into the [SSS website](https://www.sss.gov.ph).</br>
Note that you must use Internet Explorer Version 11 for optimal viewing and functionality.</br>

### Notes
1) The [SSS Contribution Form](https://www.sss.gov.ph/sss/DownloadContent?fileName=Contributions_Payment_Form.pdf) also includes intructions on when to file and pay your contributions, e.g. if the 10th digit of your SS number is 5 or 6, the payment deadline is the 20th of the month.</br></br>
2) Print the following: a) PAYOR's COPY, b) SSS' COPY, and c) COA's (Commision On Audit) COPY.</br>
--> You need not have to print the page with the Instructions for each copy.</br></br>
3) Bring a pen.</br></br>
4) You can pay your contributions at Bayad Centers as well as Supermarkets, e.g. Robinsons Supermarket.</br></br>
5) There is no additional service fee, unlike the 8pesos service fee for PhilHealth contributions at Bayad Centers or 10pesos at SaveMore Markets.</br></br>
6) I've observed that there is less people paying contributions at Robinsons Supermarket (Sumulong Highway, Corner Gil Fernando Ave., Marikina City).</br></br>
7) If the age of the member is 55 years old or older, and his/her Monthly Salary Credit (MSC), i.e. a person's monthly salary, is more than 10K pesos, the allowed increase is only one salary bracket.</br>
--> Refer to the [SSS Guidebook](https://www.sss.gov.ph/sss/DownloadContent?fileName=2017%20SSS%20Guidebook.pdf), particularly the SSS Contribution Schedule (Effective January 2014) on page 39.
