"The Offline eBIRForms Package is a tax preparation software that allows taxpayers and ATAs to accomplish or fill up tax forms offline. Instead of the conventional manual process of filling up tax returns on pre-printed forms that is highly susceptible to human error, taxpayers/ATAs can directly encode data, validate, edit, save, delete, view, print and submit their tax returns. The package can do automatic computations and has the capability to validate information encoded by taxpayers/ATAs. After filling out the forms in this package, taxpayers/ATAs can submit it to the Online eBIRForms System."

## Notes:
1) While a person can still use the eBIRForms Package to automatically send BIR tax forms online, this is only for those transactions without tax dues.</br>
--> For tax forms, e.g. 2551Q Quarterly Percentage Tax, where a person would need to pay tax dues, he/she can print the filled up tax form and go to a local bank that accepts BIR payments.</br></br>
2) Not all BPI branches accept BIR payments, albeit their BEA (BPI Express Assist) machine may give you a queuing number.</br>
--> At BPI Sto. Niño, Marikina City, only payments for RDO 045 is accepted.</br>
--> BPI Sto. Niño, Marikina City opens at 9AM.</br></br>
3) To make your BIR payment at a BPI branch that accepts BIR payments, you must do the following:</br>
--> You must prepare three (3) copies of the BIR Form.</br>
--> You must get the BTR・BIR Deposit Payment Slip from the Security Guard and then go to the BEA Machine to receive your queuing number.</br>
--> For the Reference Number, use the Tax Form Number, e.g. 2551Q.</br>
--> The maximum is three (3) transactions per client.</br>
--> Transactions without TIN and zero payment are not accepted.</br>

## Select Acronyms:
1) BIR = "Bureau of Internal Revenue"
2) ATA = "Accredited Tax Agents"
