# List of Software Development Tools
This is a list of the tools that I use to develop Usbong software.<br><br>
This list would be important, especially when I, for example, would need to use a new or another PC/machine to develop our software.

### Note:
Please make the time to read the License Agreements, Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, etc.<br>
I've learned quite a number of things by reading them.<br>
<b>Refer to:</b> Usbong School's [Guide to Contracts](https://github.com/usbong/documentation/blob/master/Usbong%20School/Guide%20to%20Contracts.md)

1) https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/<br>
--> last accessed: 20180820<br>
--> While there are people who are already comfortable with using GitHub itself and/or git commands executed on, for example, the Terminal, I still find this tool helpful when I push my commits onto GitHub.

2) http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/<br>
--> last accessed: 20180820<br>
--> I have still been using Eclipse (Juno version) to develop our software, e.g. Android.<br>
--> I am, however, aware and have also used other Integrated Development Enviroments (IDEs), e.g. IntelliJ and Android Studio.

3) https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html<br>
--> last accessed: 20180821<br>
--> I use the newest version of XAMPP, i.e. version 7.2.8, to install the following:<br>
--> a) Apache Server<br>
--> b) MySQL<br>
--> c) phpMyAdmin<br>
--> d) PHP<br>

4) https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.5.8.html<br>
--> last accessed: 20180821<br>
--> I use both Notepad++ and Notepad.<br>
--> I use Notepad++ for my Weekly Status Reports (WSRs), which would contain a list of the tasks that I've done and haven't yet done, etc.<br>
--> I use Notepad for various tasks, e.g. writing emails, removing text formatting.<br>

5) https://winscp.net/eng/download.php<br>
--> last accessed: 20180823<br>
--> This is a tool that I use to conveniently transfer files to our servers from a Windows machine to a Linux-based one.

6) https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/<br>
--> last accessed: 20180926<br>
--> I use this tool to connect from a Windows machine to a Linux-based server via SSH (Secure Shell).<br>
--> I can also configure PuTTY to use my private key to authenticate my SSH connection.<br>
--> As soon as I am able to successfully connect to the server, I can then execute commands on the Terminal.<br>

7) https://www.gimp.org/downloads/<br>
--> last accessed: 20181001<br>
--> I use this tool to do certain things such as:<br>
--> a) determining the hexadecimal value of a color (for use at the code-level)<br>
--> b) drawing and coloring my own illustrations using a WACOM tablet and stylus<br>
--> c) drawing and coloring existing illustrations that I trace and modify using a WACOM tablet and stylus<br>
--> For b) and c), though, I find the Apple iPad, Pencil, and Adobe Sketch to be a quicker alternative tool set.<br>
--> d) doing image manipulation using its filters feature, e.g. cubism, sharpen<br>
--> e) reducing the dimensions of an image by scaling and/or changing the canvas size<br>
--> f) reducing the file size of the output image file<br>
--> For f) here are two examples:<br>
--> i) I can export an image as .jpg or .jpeg with lower quality to make the file size smaller.<br>
--> ii) I can also export an image as .png and reduce the actual number of colors I use from the color palette.<br>
--> i) and ii) have helped my team and I about 15 years ago when we were developing apps on Nokia devices where only 63KB was acceptable for upload to the portal/network.<br>
--> Having said this, I do, however, still use Paint on a Windows machine when what I quickly need to do is less complex, e.g. cropping a screenshot.<br>
--> Moreover, I've learned to use Microsoft Powerpoint to more quickly make images using the various shapes, etc in its tool set.

8) https://stackoverflow.com/<br>
--> last accessed: 20181005<br>
--> I understand that we Filipinos tend to prefer to only view information provided by the service.<br>
--> This is instead of actively participating by:<br>
--> 1) voting on which solution/technique/way of doing worked in a given problem<br>
--> 2) offering a solution/technique/way of doing via the service<br>
--> 3) asking questions via the service<br>
--> However, I've learned that even by simply voting on a solution, we are already contributing towards promulgating best practices to resolve certain issues in the global community.<br>
--> Moreover, since the problem is a technical/logical issue, the solution would likely also be technical/logical.<br>
--> This means that the solution can be replicated fairly quickly as long as the problem and the steps to resolve it are clearly defined.<br>
--> Having said this, the way I typically use Stack Overflow is to enter into the search engine, e.g. Google, Bing, the keywords of the technical issue and "stackoverflow".<br>
--> Afterwards, I click on the link of the solution which appears to me would most likely resolve the technical issue.<br>
--> If I am able to find a link to a problem, but not a solution that worked in my case, I would tend to write the solution as contribution via the service.<br>
--> In terms of asking questions, I often find such questions have already been asked by other people.
