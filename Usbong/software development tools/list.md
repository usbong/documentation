# List of Software Development Tools
These are what I use to develop Usbong software.<br><br>
This list would be important, especially when I, for example, would need to use a new or another PC/machine to develop our software.

--> While there are people who are already comfortable with using GitHub itself and/or git commands executed on, for example, the Terminal, I still find this tool helpful when I push my commits onto GitHub.

2) http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/<br>
--> last accessed: 20180820<br>
--> I have still been using Eclipse (Juno version) to develop our Android software.<br>
--> I am, however, aware and have also used other Integrated Development Enviroments (IDEs), e.g. IntelliJ and Android Studio.
