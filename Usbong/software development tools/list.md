# List of Software Development Tools
This is a list of the tools that I use to develop Usbong software.<br><br>
This list would be important, especially when I, for example, would need to use a new or another PC/machine to develop our software.

### Note:
Please make the time to read the License Agreements, Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, etc.<br>
I've learned quite a number of things by reading them.<br>

--> last accessed: 20180820<br>
--> While there are people who are already comfortable with using GitHub itself and/or git commands executed on, for example, the Terminal, I still find this tool helpful when I push my commits onto GitHub.

2) http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/<br>
--> last accessed: 20180820<br>
--> I have still been using Eclipse (Juno version) to develop our software, e.g. Android.<br>
--> I am, however, aware and have also used other Integrated Development Enviroments (IDEs), e.g. IntelliJ and Android Studio.

3) https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html<br>
--> last accessed: 20180821<br>
--> I use the newest version of XAMPP, i.e. version 7.2.8, to install the following:<br>
--> a) Apache Server<br>
--> b) MySQL<br>
--> c) phpMyAdmin<br>
--> d) PHP<br>

4) https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.5.8.html<br>
--> last accessed: 20180821<br>
--> I use both Notepad++ and Notepad.<br>
--> I use Notepad++ for my Weekly Status Reports (WSRs), which would contain a list of the tasks that I've done and haven't yet done, etc.<br>
--> I use Notepad for various tasks, e.g. writing emails, removing text formatting.<br>

5) https://winscp.net/eng/download.php<br>
--> last accessed: 20180823<br>
--> This is a tool that I use to conveniently transfer files to our servers from a Windows machine to a Linux-based one.

6) https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/<br>
--> last accessed: 20180926<br>
--> I use this tool to connect from a Windows machine to a Linux-based server via SSH (Secure Shell).<br>
--> I can also configure PuTTY to use my private key to authenticate my SSH connection.<br>
--> As soon as I am able to successfully connect to the server, I can then execute commands on the Terminal.<br>
