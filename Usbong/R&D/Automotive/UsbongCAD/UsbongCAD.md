# Notes: Usbong CAD (Computer-Aided Design)

## Use Maparaang Pagbibilang, i.e. Math, equations to noticeably reduce file size<br/>
--> Vector graphics to Math equations<br/>
--> This is instead of image textures.<br/>
--> Additional Note: 1) Use of Random Access Memory (RAM) lower; In its stead, we use the Computer Processor more.<br/>
