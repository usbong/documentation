## Solution:
1) Disconnect both wireless and wired connections.<br/>
--> The Windows machine should have no Internet access.
2) Exit/End executing processes from network communication tools, e.g. LAN Messenger, Viber.<br/>
--> verified: with LAN Messenger (version 1.2.35) and Viber (2020-12-09T1958).

Additional Note: 
1) Usage of Central Processing Unit (CPU) and Physical Memory, i.e. Random Access Memory (RAM), not maxed out.<br/>
--> RAM: stored data in computer memory disappears when there is no more electricity
