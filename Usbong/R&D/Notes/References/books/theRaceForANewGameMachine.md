## 1. End of 2007, Worldwide Sales
<b>PlayStation 3 units:</b> >10M<br/>
<b>Microsoft Xbox 360 units:</b> >19M<br/>
<b>Nintendo Wii units:</b> >21M<br/>
<br/>
## 2. Sony, Toshiba, IBM (STI) Partnership: Design Center
### 2.1 Input:
<b>SONY:</b> Consumer Products<br/>
<b>TOSHIBA:</b> High Volume Products<br/>
<b>IBM:</b> Microprocessor System Design<br/>

### 2.2 Output:
<b>TOSHIBA:</b> High-end Television (TV)<br/>
<b>IBM:</b> New Chips in High-performance Servers<br/>

### 2.3 Objective:
<b>SONY:</b> create anew; Leapfrog Intel's technology via supercomputer-on-a-chip<br/>
where: <b>supercomputer-on-a-chip</b> = "...both multigigahertz frequency and very high-floating-point mathematical computation capability"

#### Additional Note:
"Floating-point units are included in many microprocessors, but they involve some very complex circuitry with a high transistor count, which translates into costly silicon real estate. Due to this complexity and size, they create much greater challenges for achieving high frequencies."<br/>
<br/>

## 3. Jim Kahle @IBM Research Group
<b>design tools:</b> "money-saving, software-based programs that improved the quality of a design by automatically checking for errors, cross talk in the wires, and other design points that exceeded acceptable limits."<br/>
--> used: with high-performance Unix servers

## 4. Engineering Solution: schedule, risk, quality
Most engineering problems have more than 1 solution;<br/>
Verify alternatives and make decisions based on <b>schedule</b>, <b>risk</b>, <b>quality</b><br/>

#### Additional Note:
<b>schedule</b> : TIME<br/>
<b>risk</b> : COST<br/>
<b>quality</b> : QUALITY<br/>
<br/>
"Trust, but verify."<br/>

## 5. Project Management
tracks weekly progress based on:<br/>
<b>area</b>, <b>frequency</b>, and <b>power</b><br/>
If ineffective, daily updates<br/>

#### Additional Note:
<b>area</b> : WISDOM? COURAGE?<br/>
<b>frequency</b> : WISDOM? COURAGE?<br/>
<b>power</b> : POWER<br/>
