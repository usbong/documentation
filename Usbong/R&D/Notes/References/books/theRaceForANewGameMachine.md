## 2. Sony, Toshiba, IBM (STI) Partnership: Design Center
### 2.1 Input:
<b>SONY:</b> Consumer Products<br/>
<b>TOSHIBA:</b> High Volume Products<br/>
<b>IBM:</b> Microprocessor System Design<br/>
<br/>

### 2.2 Output:
<b>TOSHIBA:</b> High-end Television (TV)<br/>
<b>IBM:</b> New Chips in High-performance Servers<br/>

### 2.3 Objective:
<b>SONY:</b> create anew; Leapfrog Intel's technology via supercomputer-on-a-chip<br/>
where <b>supercomputer-on-a-chip</b>: "...both multigigahertz frequency and very high-floating-point mathematical computation capability"

#### Additional Note:
"Floating-point units are included in many microprocessors, but they involve some very complex circuitry with a high transistor count, which translates into costly silicon real estate. Due to this complexity and size, they create much greater challenges for achieving high frequencies."<br/>
