## 2. Sony, Toshiba, IBM (STI) Partnership: Design Center
### 2.1 Input:
<b>SONY:</b> Consumer Products<br/>
<b>TOSHIBA:</b> High Volume Products<br/>
<b>IBM:</b> Microprocessor System Design<br/>

### 2.2 Output:
<b>TOSHIBA:</b> High-end Television (TV)<br/>
<b>IBM:</b> New Chips in High-performance Servers<br/>

### 2.3 Objective:
<b>SONY:</b> create anew; Leapfrog Intel's technology via <b>supercomputer-on-a-chip</b><br/>
where: <b>supercomputer-on-a-chip</b> = "...both multigigahertz frequency and very high-floating-point mathematical computation capability"

#### Additional Notes:
1) "Floating-point units are included in many microprocessors, but they involve some very complex circuitry with a high transistor count, which translates into costly silicon real estate. Due to this complexity and size, they create much greater challenges for achieving high frequencies."<br/>

2) Floating-point numbers, i.e. numbers with decimal points, cause more accurate computation outputs than only whole numbers, i.e. Integers.<br/>
<b>Example:</b><br/>
If with floating-point numbers: 10.0/3.0=3.3333...<br/>
If with whole numbers, 10/3=3<br/>

##### Example Application#1: 
Computing the size of each Image TILE of a 2-Dimensional (2D) GRID based on the Computer/Television Monitor's Screen Width and Height

##### Example Application#2: 
Computing the size of a 2D Square Shape based on the Computer/Television Monitor's Screen Width and Height<br/>
--> We CAN use ratios, instead of setting the exact size.<br/>
--> <b>Example:</b> 0.5 x 0.5, where 1.0 is the max size of Screen width and height

##### Example Application#3: 
Computing the new direction and position of a RobotShip 2D Image<br/>
--> This is after rotating it at its center 45degrees clock-wise,<br/>
--> AND moving it 0.2 steps in the horizontal and vertical axes.<br/> 
--> With higher frequencies, increasing the number of rotating and horizontal+vertical moving images does NOT become noticeably slow.

##### Example Application#4: 
Computing the output shape of a 3-Dimensional (3D) object with increased total number of points as vertex<br/>
--> <b>Reminder:</b> Square 2D shape has 4 vertices; Cube 3D shape has 24 vertices, some of which are reused.

## 3. Jim Kahle @IBM Research Group
<b>design tools:</b> "money-saving, software-based programs that improved the quality of a design by automatically checking for errors, cross talk in the wires, and other design points that exceeded acceptable limits."<br/>
--> used: with high-performance Unix servers

## 4. Engineering Solution: schedule, risk, quality
Most engineering problems have more than 1 solution;<br/>
Verify alternatives and make decisions based on <b>schedule</b>, <b>risk</b>, <b>quality</b><br/>

#### Additional Note:
<b>schedule</b> : TIME<br/>
<b>risk</b> : COST<br/>
<b>quality</b> : QUALITY<br/>
<br/>
"Trust, but verify."<br/>
--> Trust Unit, but verify Actions via Performance Evaluations<br/>
--> <b>reminder</b>: Problems in Work Environment causes Delays in Unit Execution<br/>
--> where: <b>Example Problems:</b><br/>
--> 1) Excess Unit members to cause identification of contribution NOT clear<br/>
--> 2) Communication NOT clear due to INDIRECT and NOT based on EVIDENCE<br/>
--> <b>reminder</b>: [History of East and West Germany](http://store.usbong.ph/server/2021/viewNewsletter202112.php)

## 5. Project Management
tracks weekly progress of <b>supercomputer-on-a-chip</b><br/>
based on: <b>area</b>, <b>frequency</b>, and <b>power</b><br/>
<br/>
If weekly ineffective, execute daily update reports<br/>
<br/>
Unit with four (4) members CAN include:<br/>
<b>Unit Chief</b>: financially accountable<br/>
<b>Project Manager (with Tech Know-How)</b>: scheduling<br/>
<b>Tech Lead</b>: Tech Assistance Lead<br/>
<b>Tech Support</b>: Tech Assistance<br/>

#### Additional Note:
<b>area</b> : WISDOM<br/>
<b>frequency</b> : COURAGE<br/>
<b>power</b> : POWER<br/>
<br/>
<b>Objective:</b><br/>
--> Decreasing chip <b>area</b><br/>
--> Increasing <b>frequency</b><br/>
--> Decreasing <b>power</b><br/>
<br/>
