## Notes
Item Purchase : contribution to advancement in universal know-how<br/>
--> However, payment is 1st for education of developers, e.g. engineers<br/>
--> observed: select nations with such developers have speed-up in advancement<br/>
<b>reminder#1</b>: increased know-how + faster computers unlock capability of nation to execute select actions, e.g. advance outward to outer space<br/>
<br/>
<b>reminder#2</b>: from history, we learn that discovery of energy resource via territorial advancement adds to increased POWER to nation<br/>
<br/>
<b>reminder#3</b>: Cheating as executed by the Teroristang Komunista group to get quick money causes the opposite of advancement to nation<br/>
<br/>
--> observed: due to quick money stolen, Teroristang Komunista group CAN buy advanced equipment items, e.g. high-speed computer sets, wireless broadcasting tools, to learn using own TIME without need for additional guidance, e.g. from school;<br/>
--> rest do NOT have money to buy such items<br/>
<br/>
--> <b>Cheating example#1:</b> technique via which parts to focus to pass school examinations shared only to select Teroristang Komunista group members' children who do NOT share such know-how with classmates<br/>
<br/>
--> <b>Cheating example#2:</b> breathing difficulty caused by Teroristang Komunista group's wireless broadcasting technology during sports competition for target child to LOSE<br/>
<br/>
<b>reminder#4</b>: NOT effective to teach VALUES via lectures to college students and older<br/>
--> <b>Recommended Reading</b>: "Harvard Med"<br/>
<br/>
--> <b>Output</b>: Teroristang Komunista group members' chldren, as based on school performance,<br/>
--> begin to become dependent on cheating via wireless broadcasting technology to get quick money;<br/>
--> Select people who were previously classified to be "SLOW" advance faster due to learned correct techniques,<br/>
--> albeit due to such action causes ENVY to Teroristang Komunista group<br/>
--> who make them become targets of attacks.<br/>
