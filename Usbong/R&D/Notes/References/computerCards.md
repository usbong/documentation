## Notes
Item Purchase : contribution to advancement in universal know-how<br/>
--> However, payment is 1st for education of developers, e.g. engineers<br/>
--> observed: select nations with such developers have speed-up in advancement<br/>
<b>reminder#1</b>: increased know-how + faster computers unlock capability of nation to execute select actions, e.g. advance outward to outer space<br/>
<br/>
<b>reminder#2</b>: from history, we learn that discovery of energy resource via territorial advancement adds to increased POWER to nation<br/>
<br/>
<b>reminder#3</b>: Cheating as executed by the Teroristang Komunista group to get quick money causes the opposite of advancement to nation

### Education Fails due to Cheating that remains Undetected
--> Undetected due to advanced equipment items, e.g. high-speed computer sets, wireless broadcasting tools, mainly available only to Communist Terroist group who execute cheating actions in school, et cetera;<br/>
<br/>
--> observed: due to quick money stolen, Teroristang Komunista group CAN buy such advanced equipment items to learn using own TIME without need for additional guidance, e.g. from school;<br/>
--> Rest do NOT yet have money to buy such items<br/>
<br/>
--> Quick Money stolen via among others:<br/>
--> carnapping (vehicular theft), smuggling (rice food, electronics, vehicles)

### Additional Cheating Examples
--> <b>Cheating example#1:</b> technique via which parts to focus to pass school examinations shared only to select Teroristang Komunista group members' children who do NOT share such know-how with classmates<br/>
<br/>
--> <b>Cheating example#2:</b> breathing difficulty caused by Teroristang Komunista group's wireless broadcasting technology during sports competition for target child to LOSE<br/>
<br/>
<b>reminder#4</b>: NOT effective to teach VALUES via lectures to college students and older<br/>
--> <b>Recommended Reading</b>: John Langone's ["Harvard Med"](https://www.amazon.com/Harvard-Med-Americas-Premier-Medical/dp/1558506101)<br/>
<br/>
--> <b>Output#1</b>: Teroristang Komunista group members' children, as based on school performance,<br/>
--> begin to become dependent on cheating via wireless broadcasting technology to get quick money;<br/>
--> Select people who were previously classified to be "SLOW" advance faster due to learned correct techniques.<br/>
--> However, such action causes ENVY to Teroristang Komunista group who make them their targets of attacks.<br/>
<br/>
--> <b>Output#2</b>: Overall know-how of Nation attacked by Teroristang Komunista group does NOT advance.<br/>
<br/>
--> <b>Recommended Action#1</b>: verify: National School Performance of children classified to be Filipino citizens<br/>
--> <b>Recommended Action#2</b>: Puksain ang mga Teroristang Komunista. No need for negotiation.<br/>
--> Puntahan sa kanilang tirahan, puksain.<br/>
<br/>
--> observed: Law Enforcement's routine movement via roads and verification via checkpoints NOT yet effective to destroy Teroristang Komunista group who continues to misuse wireless broadcasting technology to cause Noise Pollution with Physical Injury even if inside their Condominiums and does NOT go outside;<br/>
