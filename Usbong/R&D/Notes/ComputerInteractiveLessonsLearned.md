# Computer Interactive: Lessons-Learned

## 1) CAPCOM: Capsule Computer
### 1.1) ロックマン（Rockman）
--> identify and finish easiest stage and boss, then progress to harder difficulty<br/>
--> identify value of newly learned skills from defeated bosses and friend, Dr. Raito<br/>
--> Rockman 1: Elecman stage; Journey's "Faithfully" tune<br/>
--> Rockman 2: Bubbleman boss battle; technique to defeat boss once learned, maintain due to requires repetition until boss defeated; ping-pong drill<br/>
--> preference: save anywhere tool<br/>

### 1.2) Street Fighter Zero 3
--> You as Blanka can finish arcade matches in 20minutes<br/>
--> Blanka techniques easier to execute than those of Ryuu, etc<br/>
--> Using Playstation Portable (PSP), hands become difficult to move after finishing all matches in 20minutes<br/>
--> Eating rice bowl with chopsticks afterwards reminded me of manga artist who draws by hand<br/>

### 1.3) Street Fighter IV
--> Ryuu and Ken Rival Battle<br/>
--> Computer identifies if you as Ryuu execute actions intended by the developer<br/>
--> i.e., use 波動拳（hadouken）, and then 昇竜拳（shouryuuken）when opponent jumps towards you<br/>
--> Ken executes actions for you to realize what else you can do<br/>
--> You maintain to use the way, i.e. the developer's intended actions; computer identifies it; ping-pong drill<br/>
--> Computer plays Classic Street Figher II battle tune as background music<br/>
--> During battle, what Ken says encourages you; not "thrash talk"<br/>
--> Additional Note: After battles, you as Ken tells opponent encouragement, i.e. optimistic view<br/>

## 2) SEGA: SERVICE GAMES
### 2.1) Sonic 1
--> Tunes remind me of existing songs, e.g. Lighthouse Family's "Lost in Space"<br/>
--> Graphics no buffer<br/>
--> Art design of beginning stages better than later stages; 5 stages, 3 acts<br/>
--> You as Sonic move via stages and acts closer to Dr. Robotnic's headquarters, where he makes mechanical robots, even out of your animal friends<br/>
--> preference: Super Mario World<br/>

## 3) KONAMI
### 3.1) Metal Gear Solid
--> Sound<br/>
--> Virtual Reality (VR) Training; used to learn how to make mission<br/>

## 4) SONY Computer Entertainment Europe and Guerrilla
### 4.1) KillZone 2
--> Choose role as Ingeniero (Engineer); Elite mode; less death count of being killed<br/>
--> Repair robots; add robots; use available/repaired stationary machine-guns<br/>
--> Use technique in any map; however, certain maps no available stationary machine-guns<br/>

## 5) BANDAI-NAMCO
### 5.1) Tekken 6
--> Bryan Fury; 1) sweeping kick that hits when opponent is standing or down; 2) kick that hits even when opponent is crouching<br/>
--> Use combinations of 1 and 2<br/>
--> Opponent shall be in the defensive; but only you deal damage;<br/>
--> Technique can be overcome by, for example, Jin Kazama, who uses combinations of 1 and 2 faster, albeit less easier to learn to execute by a human person<br/>
--> Execution of air combos do not hit 100%, likely due to creation of world; <br/>
--> Opponent moves farther after air combos<br/>
--> Simply use combinations 1 and 2;<br/>
--> You as Bryan may not be the strongest, but using less time to memorize combos, etc can still be a strong fighter.

## 6) Shin-Nihon Kikaku (SNK): New Japan Project
## 6.1) The King of Fighters '98: Dream Match Never Ends
--> You as Kim Kaphwan can defeat final stage against Rugal B., using this technique in Single Play:<br/>
--> 1) Use Strong Punch, i.e. Kim executes a middle kick, which does not need to hit<br/>
--> Response: Rugal shall execute an electric ball<br/>
--> 2) Use charge back and then forward Strong Kick, i.e. Kim executes a slide kick to evade the electric ball and then a flying axe kick<br/>
--> Reminder: Verify distance using step 1; if too far, step 2 shall not hit<br/>
--> Reminder: If Rugal does not execute an electric ball, repeat step 1<br/>
--> Verified: You as Kim can achieve a PERFECT win<br/>
--> Additional Note: Technique to defeat boss once learned, maintain due to requires repetition until boss defeated; ping-pong drill<br/>
