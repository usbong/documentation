# Computer Interactive: Lessons-Learned

## 1) CAPCOM: Capsule Computer
### 1.1) Rockman
--> preference: save anywhere tool<br/>
--> Rockman 1: Elecman stage; Journey's "Faithfully" tune<br/>
--> Rockman 2: Bubbleman boss battle; technique to defeat boss once learned, maintain due to requires repetition until boss defeated; ping-pong drill<br/>

### 1.2) Street Fighter Zero 3
--> Blanka finish arcade matches in 20minutes<br/>
--> using PSP; hands become difficult to move<br/>
--> eat rice bowl; reminded of manga artist who draws by hand<br/>
--> Blanka techniques easy to execute, instead of Ryuu, etc<br/>

### 1.3) Street Fighter IV
--> Ryuu and Ken rival battle<br/>
--> computer identifies if you as Ryuu executes actions intended by the developer<br/>
--> i.e., use hadouken, and then shouryuuken when opponent jumps towards you<br/>
--> Ken executes actions for you to realize what else you can do<br/>
--> You maintain to use the way, i.e. the developer's intended actions; computer identifies it; ping-pong drill<br/>
--> During battle, what Ken says encourages you; not "thrash talk"<br/>
--> Additional Note: After battles, you as Ken tells opponent encouragement, i.e. optimistic view<br/>

## 2) SEGA: SERVICE GAMES
### 2.1) Sonic 1
--> tunes remind me of existing songs, e.g. "Lost in Space"<br/>
--> graphics no buffer<br/>
--> Art design of beginning stages better than later stages; 5 stages, 3 acts<br/>
--> preference: Super Mario World<br/>

## 3) KONAMI
### 3.1) Metal Gear Solid
--> Sound<br/>
--> VR Training; used to learn how to make mission<br/>

## 4) SONY
### 4.1) KillZone 2
--> Use Engineer; Elite mode; less death count of being killed<br/>
--> repair robots; add robots; use available/repaired stationary machine guns<br/>
--> technique use in any map; certain maps no available stationary machine guns<br/>

## 5) NAMCO-BANDAI
### 5.1) Tekken 6
--> Bryan Fury; 1) sweeping kick that hits when opponent is standing; 2) kick that hits when opponent is crouching<br/>
--> use combinations of 1 and 2<br/>
--> opponent shall be in the defensive; but only you deals damage;<br/>
--> Technique can be overcome by Jin, who uses combinations of 1 and 2 faster, albeit less easier to learn to execute by a human person<br/>
--> execution of air combos do not hit 100%, likely due to creation of world; <br/>
--> opponent moves farther after air combos<br/>
--> simply use combinations 1 and 2;<br/>
