# Computer Interactive: Lessons-Learned
## 1) Software
## 1.1) CAPCOM: Capsule Computer
### 1.1.1) ロックマン（Rockman）
--> identify and finish easiest stage and boss, then progress to harder difficulty<br/>
--> identify value of newly learned skills from defeated bosses and friend, Dr. Raito<br/>
--> Rockman 1: Elecman stage; Journey's "Faithfully" tune<br/>
--> Rockman 2: Bubbleman boss battle; technique to defeat boss once learned, maintain due to requires repetition until boss defeated; ping-pong drill<br/>
--> preference: save anywhere tool<br/>
--> Rockman X:<br/>
--> sigma stage: toro boss battle<br/>
--> excess use of rockets, i.e. homing missile, in stage<br/>
--> less available rockets during boss battle<br/>
--> sigma stage: spider boss battle<br/>
--> "no money", but have time<br/>
--> make money using time<br/>
--> Example: カプセル(capusel, i.e. Capsule) 　コンピュータ(Computer); CAPCOM<br/>
<br/>
TO-DO: -update: this<br/>

### 1.1.2) Street Fighter Zero 3
--> You as Blanka can finish arcade matches in 20minutes<br/>
--> Blanka techniques easier to execute than those of Ryuu, etc<br/>
--> Using Playstation Portable (PSP), hands become difficult to move after finishing all matches in 20minutes<br/>
--> Eating rice bowl with chopsticks afterwards reminded me of manga artist who draws by hand<br/>

### 1.1.3) Street Fighter IV
--> Ryuu and Ken Rival Battle<br/>
--> Computer identifies if you as Ryuu execute actions intended by the developer<br/>
--> i.e., use 波動拳（hadouken）, and then 昇竜拳（shouryuuken）when opponent jumps towards you<br/>
--> Ken executes actions for you to realize what else you can do<br/>
--> You maintain to use the way, i.e. the developer's intended actions; computer identifies it; ping-pong drill<br/>
--> Computer plays Classic Street Figher II battle tune as background music<br/>
--> During battle, what Ken says encourages you; not "thrash talk"<br/>
--> Additional Note: After battles, you as Ken tells opponent encouragement, i.e. optimistic view<br/>

## 1.2) SEGA: SERVICE GAMES
### 1.2.1) Sonic 1
--> Tunes remind me of existing songs, e.g. Lighthouse Family's "Lost in Space"<br/>
--> Graphics no buffer<br/>
--> Art design of beginning stages better than later stages; 5 stages, 3 acts<br/>
--> You as Sonic move via stages and acts closer to Dr. Robotnic's headquarters, where he makes mechanical robots, even out of your animal friends<br/>
--> preference: Super Mario World<br/>

## 1.3) KONAMI
### 1.3.1) Metal Gear Solid
--> Sound<br/>
--> Virtual Reality (VR) Training; used to learn how to make mission<br/>

## 1.4) SONY Computer Entertainment Europe and Guerrilla
### 1.4.1) KillZone 2
--> Choose role as Ingeniero (Engineer); Elite mode; less death count of being killed<br/>
--> Repair robots; add robots; use available/repaired stationary machine-guns<br/>
--> Use technique in any map; however, certain maps no available stationary machine-guns<br/>

## 1.5) BANDAI-NAMCO
### 1.5.1) Tekken 6
--> Bryan Fury; 1) sweeping kick that hits when opponent is standing or down; 2) kick that hits even when opponent is crouching<br/>
--> Use combinations of 1 and 2<br/>
--> Opponent shall be in the defensive; but only you deal damage;<br/>
--> Technique can be overcome by, for example, Jin Kazama, who uses combinations of 1 and 2 faster, albeit less easier to learn to execute by a human person<br/>
--> Execution of air combos do not hit 100%, likely due to creation of world; <br/>
--> Opponent moves farther after air combos<br/>
--> Simply use combinations 1 and 2;<br/>
--> You as Bryan may not be the strongest, but using less time to memorize combos, etc can still be a strong fighter.

## 1.6) Shin-Nihon Kikaku (SNK): New Japan Project
## 1.6.1) The King of Fighters '98: Dream Match Never Ends
--> You as Kim Kaphwan can defeat final stage against Rugal B., using this technique in Single Play:<br/>
--> 1.6.1.1) Use Strong Punch, i.e. Kim executes a middle kick, which does not need to hit<br/>
--> Response: Rugal shall execute an electric ball<br/>
--> 1.6.1.2) Use charge back and then forward Strong Kick, i.e. Kim executes a slide kick to evade the electric ball and then a flying axe kick<br/>
--> Reminder: Verify distance using step 1; if too far, step 2 shall not hit<br/>
--> Reminder: If Rugal does not execute an electric ball, repeat step 1<br/>
--> Verified: You as Kim can achieve a PERFECT win<br/>
--> 1.6.1.3) Additional Notes:<br/> 
--> 1.6.1.3.1) Technique to defeat boss once learned, maintain due to requires repetition until boss defeated; ping-pong drill<br/>
--> 1.6.1.3.2) Set difficulty level to highest; Technique not anymore effective

## 1.7) SQUARE ENIX
## 1.7.1) Final Fantasy 6 (Japanese version)
majikku card notes

  poison increased damage against tyranosaurus<br/> 
	reflect sends magic attack to enemy (reflected magic is not reflected again)<br/>
	genjuu summon is not reflected<br/>
	reflect from all 4 team members sends magic attack x4<br/>

### 1.7.1.2) items inventory:

    back row position received (non-magic) damage 1/2.<br/>		
		tiger claw stronger than dragon claw
		
#### 1.7.1.2.3) enemy/monster
	profile, e.g. weakness, not yet known can destroy whole team<br/>
	after verifying what defense to use, e.g. gravitate spell to evade earthquake attack,<br/>
					what attack to use, e.g. faira, i.e. fire attack level 2<br/>
	add random enemy encounter (pinagninilayan ko pa ang gagawin at inaalam kung saan ang daan, may lalabas na agad na kalaban/halimaw; naalala ko ang Wild Arms (PS1), bagama't mas mabilis ang loading dito)<br/>
	add active time battle, i.e. undecided team member is skipped in turn sequence<br/>

#### 1.7.1.2.4) team member character
	
	
#### Additional Note:
1) Sa pook na magugunaw na ang mundo dahil sa kagagawan ni Kefka, na hinigitan pa ang kapangyarihan ng Emperor, ipaaalam sa iyo ng kompyuter na may magagawa ka pa bago ang katapusan.<br/>
--> Halimbawa: May mga magic, e.g. poison, item, e.g. reflect ring, at team member na kailangan mo rin, bukod pa sa mga kinasanayan mo.

## 2) Hardware
## 2.1) SONY PlayStation Portable (PSP)
--> <b>Problem:</b> When playing Universal Media Disc (UMD) game, PSP keeps on displaying 「ゲームを終了しますか (Do you end the game?)」<br/>
--> <b>Solution:</b> Add masking tape with folded paper on the protruding portion on the right side of UMD lid near the battery.<br/>
--> This is so as to securely press the sensor button when the lid is closed.<br/>
<br/>
--> <b>Additional Notes:</b><br/>
--> 2.1.1) The thin metal near sensor button will bend due to the added masking tape when the lid is closed.<br/> 
--> 2.1.2) verified: with pre-used PSP (Model 2001)<br/>

--> 「・PSPの蓋を感知するセンサーが誤動作を起こしている」

## 2.2) Nintendo 64 (ろくよん rokuyon)
--> <b>Problem:</b> N64 unit automatically resets<br/>
--> <b>Solution:</b> Use a foldable object to securely connect the Power Supply Adapter to the N64 unit<br/>
--> Previously, the Power Supply Adapter was wobbly.<br/>
--> In addition, the display on the Television/Computer Monitor to which the N64 unit was connected was unclear, e.g. blurry.<br/>
--> <b>Reminder:</b> Insufficient electricity causes machine/device problems.<br/>
<br/>
--> <b>Additional Notes:</b><br/>
--> 2.2.1) verified: using paper envelope with plastic as cover as the foldable object<br/>
--> <b>Reminder:</b> Paper can catch fire, albeit usually spark from fire occurs when connecting Power Supply plug to the electrical outlet.<br/>
--> 2.2.2) verified: with pre-used N64 console unit (Japanese version)<br/>
