# Human Language Translation Tools

The following are tools that you can use to assist you in doing translation work as a service provider.</br>
</br>
You should, however, be careful when you begin to rely on delegating the translation of entire sentences to these tools.</br>
</br>
Use example sentences to help you understand how to properly use the words.

### Note: 
In this context, "translation" pertains to written language, while "interpretation" pertains to oral language.

## I. General
1) https://www.google.com/</br>
--> You can enter in the search engine a sentence pattern and then if the results show that websites use such pattern, then it is likely, but not necessary guaranteed, that it is correct.

2) https://translate.google.com/</br>
--> This tool may be more helpful to you as a guide to translate individual words, instead of entire sentences.</br>
--> Interestingly, I use this to verify the pronunciation of words in certain languages, e.g. Latin, Italian, French, German.

## II. Japanese Language/nihongo
1) https://ejje.weblio.jp</br>
--> This is a tool that was recommended to me by a Japanese translator/interpreter.</br>
--> The caveat is that the website is predominantly in nihongo.

2) http://nihongo.monash.edu/cgi-bin/wwwjdic?1C</br>
--> This is a tool that I would recommend even beginning students to use.</br>
--> This is because you should be able to navigate the website fairly easily if you understand the English language.

## III. Spanish language/espa√±ol
1) http://spanishdict.com/</br>
--> This is a tool that provides verb conjugation tables, sample sentences, among others.
--> It also indicates whether a phrase or an expression is particularly used in Latin America/Hispanic countries or in Spain.

## IV. Chinese Mandarin
1) https://www.pleco.com/</br>
--> This is a dictionary tool that runs on mobile devices, e.g. Android, iOS.</br>
--> You can set it to display both traditional and simplified hanzi or Chinese characters.</br>
--> You can also set it to display both pinyin and zhuyin/bopomofo.</br>
--> The app can also pronounce words for you.

2) https://www.yellowbridge.com/chinese/dictionary.php</br>
--> If you are unable to use Pleco on your mobile device, this tool may be your next best alternative.</br>
--> You can use it to understand not only the meaning of a whole word/character, but also its individual components.</br>
--> This concept can be applied in various, seemingly unrelated contexts such as business, medicine, systems integration, community development, among others.</br>
--> For example, in business, a value of a corporation may be higher, even if the selling price of its pieces is lower, e.g. valued at 50pesos for the price of 20pesos.</br>
--> In the medical field, we learn that a human person is alive, not simply because we get the sum of his/her individual organs, tissues, cells, etc.
